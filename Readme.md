# CryptX

CryptX is a very simple, web-based application to aid in solving cryptographic cyphers. This was originally developed as a project for a college cryptography course. I've decided to make it available here in the hopes that it may prove useful to someone. As time allows, I may update this project to add new features or modernize the codebase.
